We want to develop an efficient and easy to use finite element software
package to support our teach and research work. 

We still have lot work to do. 

# Installation

## From Source (Recommanded)

First, clone the FEALPy repository from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weihuayi/fealpy.git
```

If you can't acess GitHub, you can clone it from Gitee
```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/whymath/fealpy
```

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv fealpy_env
source fealpy_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `fealpy_env\Scripts\activate`
```

Then change directory to the cloned repository and install FEALPy in editable(`-e`) mode:
```bash
cd fealpy
pip install -e .
```

If you want to install optional dependencies, such as `pypardiso`, `pyamg`, `meshpy` and so on, you can do so by specifying the [optional] extra:
```
pip install -e .[optional]
```

To install both development and optional dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install -e .[dev, optional]
```
To verify that FEALPy is installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import fealpy; print(fealpy.__version__)"
```

To update your FEALPy installation to the latest version from the source repository, navigate to the FEALPy directory and pull the latest changes:
```bash
cd fealpy
git pull origin main
pip install -e .
```

To uninstall FEALPy, just run the following command:
```bash
pip uninstall fealpy
```

## Development


## Warning 
The sparse pattern of the matrix `A` generated by `FEALPy` may not be the same as the theoretical pattern, since there exists nonzero values that are close to machine precision due to rounding. If you care about the sparse pattern of the matrix, you can use the following commands to eliminate them
```python
eps = 10**(-15)
A.data[ np.abs(A.data) < eps ] = 0
A.eliminate_zeros()
```

## Docker

To be added.
