## Memoization (to be remembered)

Memoisation is a technique used in computing to speed up programs. This is
accomplished by memorizing the calculation results of processed input such as
the results of function calls. If the same input or a function call with the
same parameters is used, the previously stored results can be used again and
unnecessary calculation are avoided. In many cases a simple array is used for
storing the results, but lots of other structures can be used as well, such as
associative arrays, called hashes in Perl or dictionaries in Python.
